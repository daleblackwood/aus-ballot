In addition to environmentalism, the party cites four core values: ecological sustainability, social justice, grassroots democracy and peace and non-violence.[3]\n\nParty constituencies can be traced to various origins – notably the early environmental movement in Australia and the formation of the United Tasmania Group (UTG), one of the first green parties in the world,[4] but also the nuclear disarmament movement in Western Australia and sections of the industrial left in New South Wales. Co-ordination between environmentalist groups occurred in the 1980s with various significant protests.
