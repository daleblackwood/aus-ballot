  "wikipediaPreview": "\n\nThe Christian Democratic Party (CDP) is a socially conservative political party in Australia. It was founded by a group of concerned Christian ministers in the State of NSW, who had Fred Nile, a Congregational Church minister, run as their Upper House Candidate in the NSW State election. Fred Nile commonly refers to himself as the party's founder; however, the Party states that it was founded by concerned Australian ministers.[3]\n\nThe party was established in 1977 under the name Call to Australia, which it used until 1998. It is primarily active in New South Wales, and since the 1981 state election has had at least one member in the New South Wales Legislative Council, often holding or sharing the balance of power. The Christian Democrats have never elected anyone to federal parliament, although John Bradford briefly sat with the party in the House of Representatives after defecting from the Liberal Party prior to the 1998 election.\n\n..."
