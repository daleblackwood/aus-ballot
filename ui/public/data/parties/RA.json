  "wikipediaPreview": "\n\nThe Reason Party is an Australian political party founded in 2009 as the Australian Sex Party. It changed its name in 2017 to the Reason Party. The Australian Sex Party was initially founded in response to concerns over the increasing influence of religion in Australian politics, and the proposed introduction of an internet filter[2][3] and was born out of an adult-industry lobby group, the Eros Association. Its leader, Fiona Patten, was formerly the association's CEO.[4] Patten describes the party as a \"civil libertarian alternative\".[5] Patten is a veteran campaigner on issues such as censorship, equality, and discrimination.[6][7] Patten was elected to the Victorian Legislative Council at the 2014 state election in the Northern Metropolitan Region. She was re-elected for another four-year term at the 2018 state election.\n\n..."
