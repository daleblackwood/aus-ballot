The SEP was established in 2010 as the successor party to the Socialist Labour League, which was founded in 1972 as the Australian section of the International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI). Following the 1980s split in the ICFI, the party follows the David North current.[2]\n\nOne of the three federally-registered socialist parties in Australia (the others being Socialist Alliance and Victorian Socialists), the SEP is sometimes described by other parties on the left as sectarian and ultra-leftist.[3] According to its 2019 election statement, the party opposes identity politics and the Me Too movement.[4] The party also opposes trade unions, having adopted \"the Bordigist position that the trade unions are no longer workers organisations having been entirely incorporated into the capitalist state\".[5]\n\n..."
