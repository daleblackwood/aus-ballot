  "wikipediaPreview": "The Australian Labor Party (Northern Territory Branch), commonly known as Territory Labor is the Northern Territory branch of the Australian Labor Party.[3] It has been the governing party of the Northern Territory since winning the 2016 election under Michael Gunner. It previously held office from 2001 to 2012.[4][5]\n\nThe first Labor candidate from the Northern Territory - which was then represented by the Northern Territory seat in the South Australian House of Assembly - was Pine Creek miner and former City of Adelaide alderman James Robertson in 1905. The first Labor MP was Thomas Crush, who was elected at a 1908 by-election and accepted into the South Australian Labor caucus despite not having signed the Labor pledge. He was re-elected in 1910, and served until the Northern Territory formally separated from South Australia in 1911, resulting in the loss of the seat in state parliament. A non-voting federal seat in the Australian House of Representatives, the Division of Northern Territory, was established for the 1922 election, and was won by independent candidate and former union leader Harold George Nelson, who joined the Labor caucus after the election.[6]\n\n..."
